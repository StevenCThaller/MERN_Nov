/* 
    Given a string, containing letters, single digit ints, and question marks
    return whether or not there are exactly 3 question marks between EVERY two ints that add up to 10
        - if there are no two ints that add up to 10, return false
    Helpful functions:
        parseInt(char) => NaN or the string parsed to an int
        isNaN(x) => true or false
            - need to use isNaN if you want to know if something is NaN
            - the number 0 is falsy
            - NaN is falsy
    
    EXAMPLE:
    questionMarks("acc?7??sss?3rr1??????5") will return true, because there are 3 question marks between 7 and 3

    questionMarks("aa2?1??aalkg") will return false, because there are not 3 question marks between 2 and 1
